✋ Hand Gesture Whiteboard

A computer-vision–powered virtual whiteboard that lets you draw in the air using only your hand gestures.
The project uses MediaPipe, OpenCV, and custom logic to detect hand landmarks, finger positions, and interactive UI buttons (colors, pen sizes, erase, clear, board toggle).

🚀 Features

•Real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe

•Draw on a virtual whiteboard by lifting only your index finger

•Color palette toggle

•Pen size selection

•Eraser tool

•Clear entire canvas

Toggle whiteboard visibility

•Smooth line drawing and finger-following cursor

•Fully gesture-controlled (no mouse/keyboard needed)

🧠 How It Works

•The app uses a custom class HandTracker (in handTracker.py) to:

•Detect hands using MediaPipe Hands

•Extract landmark positions

•Determine which fingers are raised

•Use the index fingertip as the drawing pointer

•The main app (main.py) uses these finger states to toggle UI menus and draw on a transparent canvas layered over the camera feed.
